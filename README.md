### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Luana Oliveira and I am a physicist who works with data science. I am an undergraduate student at Universidade Virtual de SÃ£o Paulo (Univesp), currently on my first semester.

#About me

I live Brazil, so my native language is portuguese. I always liked to study and always had a passion for exact sciences. In the middle of my final year in high school, in 2012, I was accepted in Universidade de BrasÃ­lia (UnB) to attend a physics course. I graduated at the end of 2017, soon entering a master's program in the same university, with focus on cosmology and radioastronomy. At the same time I started working as a physics teacher in local public schools and so I remained for almost 4 years until I've decided to follow another career.

#An interesting story

The year is 2020, a pandemic starts and we are all forced to stay home to protect ourselves and everybody else from this disease. During this reclusion time, I've decided to leave my master's program and pursue something that I've wanted to since the middle of undergrad: a career in computer science. I ended up moving to another state and becoming a student again. Now I study bachelor's in data science and I am very happy to say that I also work in the field.

#Another passion

I love to unravel the misteries of other cultures, hence I am always trying to learn new languages to accomplish that. I speak fluently English, I attended a basic course of french in University, I've studied german for almost 5 years now (with some pauses along the way),  and I am also studying Japanese for almost a year now.
