## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luana Oliveira and I am a physicist who currently works with data engineering. I am an undergraduate student at Universidade Virtual de SÃ£o Paulo [(Univesp)](https://univesp.br/), on my final year. My topics of interest are Data Engineering, Machine Learning and applications .

### About me

I always liked to study and always had a passion for hard sciences. In the middle of my final year in high school, in 2012, I was accepted at the Universidade de BrasÃ­lia [(UnB)](https://www.unb.br/) to attend a physics course. I graduated at the end of 2017, soon entering a master's program in the same university, with focus on cosmology and radioastronomy and a computation approach. At the same time I started working as a physics teacher in local public schools and so I remained for almost 4 years until I decided to make a career change.

### Long story short

The year is 2020, a pandemic starts and during this reclusion time I have decided to leave my master's program and pursue an old dream of mine: a career in computer science. I ended up moving to another state and becoming a student again. Now I'm studying for a bachelor's in data science whilst working as Data Engineer.

### Other passions

I was born in Brazil, so my native language is portuguese. Growing up I've always loved to unravel the misteries of other cultures, hence I started learning new languages to accomplish that. I speak English fluently and I have been studying other languages over the years, such as French, German and Japanese. I now live in Germany, trying to make amends with my German.. and make new friends.

### What I am working on now..

I have been working on personal projects related to computer vision and NLP.

Here I'll be sharing some codes and projects, nothing fancy, just trying new stuff.
